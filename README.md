# Stock Price Prediction AI Project

## Introduction
This project aims to predict stock prices using various deep learning models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The project also includes preprocessing steps to prepare the data for training and testing. Additionally, visualization techniques are employed to analyze the performance of the models.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of historical stock price data obtained from [source]. It includes features such as opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, and volume traded for each day.

## Preprocessing
Before feeding the data into the deep learning models, several preprocessing steps are performed:
- **Normalization**: All features are normalized to ensure that they are on the same scale, preventing any particular feature from dominating the others.
- **Sequence Generation**: The dataset is split into sequences of fixed length, with each sequence representing a window of historical data. This step is crucial for training the sequential models like RNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU.

## Deep Learning Models
The following deep learning models are implemented for stock price prediction:
1. **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**: A basic RNN model is trained on the sequence data to capture temporal dependencies.
2. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: LSTM networks are used to overcome the vanishing gradient problem in traditional RNNs and better capture long-term dependencies.
3. **Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)**: BiLSTM networks are employed to leverage both past and future information for prediction.
4. **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)**: Similar to LSTM, GRU networks are designed to capture long-term dependencies but with fewer parameters.

## Training and Evaluation
The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with a portion of the data reserved for validation during training. Each model is trained using the training data and evaluated using the testing data. Evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are calculated to assess the performance of each model.

## Visualization
To visualize the performance of the models, the predicted stock prices are compared against the actual prices using line plots. Additionally, other visualization techniques such as candlestick charts may be employed to provide a more detailed analysis of the predictions.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of various deep learning models in predicting stock prices. By preprocessing the data and utilizing models such as RNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU, accurate predictions can be made, aiding investors in making informed decisions. The visualization techniques employed provide insights into the performance of the models and aid in interpreting the results.
